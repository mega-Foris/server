##Description
Foris is an outdoor event application where users can create and join events based on their outdoor interests and skill level. Currently, Foris supports the following sports: kayaking, hiking, biking, and climbing. Users can search for upcoming events based off of difficulty and sport. Each event page includes information regarding the event such as location, date, difficulty, duration, and other users attending. If interested, a user can find out more about other attendees of an event by visiting their user profile. Once signed in, users can create events and share with other users in hopes of finding other like minded people to join the event!
